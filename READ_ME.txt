This repository contains the code used in the experiments for the following paper:

Can Meta-Interpretive Learning outperform Deep Reinforcement Learning of Evaluable Game strategies?. IJCAI 2019.

These experiments require YAP Prolog to run (available at http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/), we used YAP 6.3.4 in all experiments. This work is based upon the Metagol system (Andrew Cropper and Stephen H. Muggleton, 2016, available at https://github.com/metagol/metagol).

The input and output data are located in the subdirectories ./inputs/  ./output respectively.

To run an experiment, execute test/4 from the file experiment.pl located in one of the game directory.
